# Prototype Web Residency

### A tranquil web residency for casual investigations into how we (from people to plants) interface with our planetary computer.

### What?
Prototype Web Residency is a prototype...web residency.

It seeks to encourage new adventures and peripheral forays into the unknown. What kind of unknown? Well: New modes of engagement. New philosophies. Alternative relationships. Communications in compassion. Experiments in space and time. Ritual design. Warping identity. Theatre. Matter-of-fact monologues. Creating new metaphors.


### Who?
It seeks to bring together a diverse group of residents with a shared interest in exploring alternatives to today's status quo. Everyone is welcome to participate.


### Why?
Why not?


### When?
The inaugural edition ran from January to April, 2019 with 28 brave souls. Subsequent editions will be forthcoming at irregular intervals. Our ambition is for a twice annual extravaganza.

# Roll Your Own

Want to run your own web residency? You're welcome to use our template :v:


## Theme
The theme is, of course, up to you. Clearly define your theme in explicit language to attract people enthusiastic to explore it.


## Duration
Project submissions are open for 3 weeks before the residency start date. 
The residency proper runs for 12 weeks: enough time to make it productively habitual but not overbearing.


## Submissions
All submissions are accepted. For PWR01 they were submitted [into an open Are.na channel](https://www.are.na/prototype-web-residency/pwr01-submissions) with the following information:

```
1. The name of your project
2. A two sentence outline.
3. What you want to have at the end of the 3 months (a document, a functional prototype, a dysfunctional prototype, some complicated drawings on blue technical paper, etc.)
4. Your email address (to help organize the weekly residency calls)
```

## Structure
The residency has two explicit activities:

### A rotating weekly one hour video call
Conducted with 2-3 other residents in which you share your project, your progress, questions and feedback. These were held via Google Hangouts, but any similar program will do. 

The goal of these calls is to:

1. Meet your fellow residents
2. Give and receive inspiration
3. Share feedback & references on your respective projects.

The residents all said that these conversations were the highlight of the program and very inspiring. :tada:

### A recommended bi-weekly written update** 

That's encouraged as a stream of consciousness outline of:

1. The progress of your project & mood 
2. Your notes from your recent residency calls
3. Any questions, concerns, considerations and interventions on your mind.

The bi-weekly updates were only half heartedly followed in the first PWR residency. There are probably several reasons: 

1. There was no implicit social contract to write them, compared to the calls which have one (you don't want to let down the others on the call).
2. Writing may not be a natural or pleasant experience for many. Talking is easier.
3. There wasn't enough direction or structure to guide the writing process or make it easier to get started.
4. Most residency members irregularly updated their project folders with references, ideas, and writing intermittently when they had things to record. Imposing a single, regimented "time to write" may not be the best approach.

I'd encourage you to tie the writing process more explicitly into the calls (i.e. by encouraging residents to publish their notes) or structure this more casually as an on-going, intermittent publishing exercise.
