Prototype Web Residency is a prototype...web residency.. running from January to April, 2019. It seeks to bring together a diverse group of residents with a shared interest in exploring alternatives to today's status quo.

This could mean:

New modes of engaging. New philosophies. Alternative relationships. Communications in compassion. Experiments in space and time. Ritual design. Warping identity. Theatre. Matter-of-fact monologues. Creating new metaphors.
